# Pipeline Utils RS

> Supporting utilities for the [DeepLEAP](https://github.com/HIVDiversity/deepleap/) pipeline

The Pipeline-Utils-RS project, or PURS, provides utilities for the functioning of the DeepLEAP alignment pipeline.
However, its utilities are available for standalone use. Features include:

- Collapse and Expand FASTA files based on sequence identity.
- Get the consensus sequence from a FASTA file.
- Extract a sequence from a GenBank file based on the sequence ID.
- Replace ambiguous nucleotide characters with standard (ACTG) characters.
- Translate sequences in a FASTA file, with customizable rules regarding gaps and ambiguous codons.
- Trim a SAM file based on reference coordinates.
- Reverse translate an amino acid alignment using the un-aligned nucleotide sequences.
